## General Rules

#### No spamming
Spamming is banned under every condition. Warning points will be issued depending on how much harm you did.
  
#### No exploiting glitches/bugs
If you find a glitch or bug in one of our servers/mini-games, do not use it for advantages over other players or to troll. Just report the glitch/bug to us by sending an email. You will recieve a reward.

You may also contact a staff member directly using `/msg <staff member name> <message ...>`. Do not talk it aloud, as this will let other players know this and increase the chance of the glitch/bug being exploited.

This also means no abusing/exploiting Minecraft glitches/bugs.

#### Treat everyone with respect
That means **no harassing player**s or using racial slurs **or threatening** players. Everyone should be treated with respect. If someone is disrespecting you badly (threatening, harassing etc.) in chat, please [report](#reporting) that player. (Click the hyperlink to see how to report conveniently)

#### Do not threaten to hack the server
If you do so, we wil mute you and possibly issue warning points.
  
#### Use an appropriate username
Any inappropriate usernames will be banned. To make it clear what "inappropriate" means, you can refer to mainly this list:
* The default username, "Steve"
* Names that are offensive to most people
* Technical names that would cause server bugs. These include "legionpe", "rcon", "server", "console" and "pocketmine".
* Any other names that our staffs feel inappropriate

#### There is no advertising allowed
Advertising other servers, YouTube channels, websites, etc. are banned. Warning points will be issued depending on actual circumstances.

If you find a player advertising, please [report](#reporting) that player. (Click the hyperlink to see how to report conveniently)

#### No unfair mods
Mods that give you advantage over other players (excluding anti-lagginess mods) are not allowed.

#### Use capitalization correctly
That means writing whole sentances is caps is not allowed. Use capital letters with proper grammar.

#### Do not swear
Offensive words are banned under every circumstance. This server is designed for players of all ages to play. Do not send adult content here.

#### Do not stand AFK
If you don't have any actions (move, interact with blocks or chat) for more than 5 minutes, you will be automatically kicked.

#### We have staff members for a reason
If you have a problem, contact a staff member. Don't hesitate to ask the question or tell your problem.

That's it! These rules will probably change.

## Reporting
The main command to report is `/report`. An abuse of `/report` will lead to penalty.

To report players who...

#### talk in chat incorrectly,
Use the `/report <player> chat [message]` (chat report) command to report.

`<player>` is the name of the player whom you want to report. The reported player **must be online** in order to let the plugin record his IP (and possibly use it to ban later).

`[message]` is optional. If you want to tell the staff member reading the report something else, put your message here.

Note that the latest 25 messages you are reading will be attached to your report. Also, if you switched to another world, it may not work correctly.

#### move incorrectly,
Use the `/report <player> move [message]` (motion report) command to report.

`<player>` is the name of the player whom you want to report. The reported player **must be online** in order to let the plugin record his IP (and possibly use it to ban later).

`[message]` is optional. If you want to tell the staff member reading the report something else, put your message here.

The position and motion of the reported player in the past minute will be attached in the report. Since this attachment is pretty large for a database, players who abuse the motion report will be severely punished. Yes, you can grief the server by spamming motion reports to a degree we want to kill you in real life and find moderators and admins under your bed.

## Staff Members
Information about staff members and their powers can be found [here](https://github.com/PEMapModder/LegionPE-Public-Resources/blob/master/info/staffs.md).

## Donating
Things about donating and ranks are mentioned at https://github.com/PEMapModder/LegionPE-Public/Resources/blob/master/LegionPE%20TODOs.md

## Warning Points
We do not ban players directly. Instead, we issue warning points. If a player receives too many warning points, he/she will be banned for a period of time according to the number of warning points. Of course, in special cases, we will directly permanently ban some players.
