Guide to play in LegionPE
===
First of all, before even joining, [read the rules](rules.md). Otherwise, you may be not even able to join.

Confirmed you have finished the rules? Continue reading. Not yet? Read it first.

#### Add LegionPE to your device
* Open Minecraft: PE, and click `Play` => `Edit` (at right-top corner) => `External` (still at right-top corner).
* Fill in the form:
```yaml
Server Name: LegionPE
Address: pe.legionpvp.eu
Port: 19132
```
* Click `Add Server`

#### Join the server
* Click the new `LegionPE` bar in your worlds list. Wait patiently as minecraft loads the world.
* If this is the first time you join...
  * You need to register with a password. This is to protect your account so that other people can't login with your name and do all kinds of bad things with your name.
  * Open the chat window with the chat bubble box at the right-top corner of your screen. Think of a password that you can remember. **_We promise not to read this password or sell or give it to anyone else_**, since we ourselves can't read your password. The password is encrypted by our plugin, so even if the server is stolen or hacked, the thief/hacker will have a hard time (or even can't) decrypting your password.
    * The password must not start with a slash (`/`).
    * The password must not be too short. It must be at least 4 characters.
  * Type the password into the chat directly and send it. Don't worry, no one else will read it. Even if you by some mistake or intentionally want to tell the whole world your password, you will not be able to do so. Our plugin will block it.
  * We will request you to type the password again to confirm you didn't type wrong. **Once you confirmed, you can't change it yourself**. 
    * If you really want to change it, we have to delete your account, clearing all data about you including coins, kills, parkour checkpoints, spleef wins, etc. However, if you can prove to us you really need it be changed, contact us. We may schedule you to have a "hashing session", where you will have to go to a webpage and enter your password, and the webpage will give you back a 128-character long code, and you have to give that code to us so that we can manually change it. In simple words, very inconvenient for both you and us.
  * Then, you will be required to type a word that tells the server if it should automatically authenticate you with your IP address (IP-auth).
    * What is an IP address?
      * An IP (Internet Protocol) address tells us where to send data (for example, the map, the chat messages, etc.) back to. Basically, as long as you always connect with your Wi-Fi at home, for most people their IP will always be the same.
      * Therefore, if you let the server automatically authenticate you, everyone at your home who changes to your username and connects to your Wi-Fi can login as you. If you have a brother who always wants to steal your things in your server, for example, do not enable IP-auth.
    * What should I answer?
      * If you don't want to use IP-auth, type `no` into chat and send it.
      * If you want the server to only authenticate you when your IP is same as the one you last logged in with, type `last`.
      * If you want the server to authenticate you whenever you login with an IP you once logged in with, type `all`.
        * _Warning_! If someone uses the same internet provider with you and you are connecting to the server via mobile network (with methods like BlockLauncher or portable hotspot), there might be 1/65536 chance that you could be using the same IP as another player. Therefore, choosing `all` isn't always a clever choice, but this rarely happens. Nevertheless, to be honest, my personal experience is that I once found out that I was using the IP same as the IP another PocketMine Forums member living in the same city used.
* If you already registered...
  * Type the password directly into chat. As mentioned, if it is correct, no one else will see it.
  * You have five chances or two minutes to login before you are kicked.
* Now, you should be able to move, chat and do other things.
  * If you are at spawn, open your inventory. If you see nothing there, use the `/switch` command (type `/switch` in chat). Your inventory will have a wooden door, an iron sword and other things. The wooden door means go back to spawn. Choose a game by clicking the item. You can also walk into a portal at spawn.
  * If you are not at spawn, you didn't go back to spawn when you last left. However, the server will still assume that you went back to spawn and joined again.

That's all! Have fun!
