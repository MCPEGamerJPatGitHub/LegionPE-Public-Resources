Basically, a list of things I would like to be in the Legion PE plugins.
This DOES NOT have to all be added in the first release!
 
Commands:
~ /stats

        Shows stats of the gamemode that you are currently playing
        Example: I am playing PvP and I want to see my PvP stats, so I type /stats and I should get a message like this:
        [PvP Stats]
        - Kills: 139

website:

we are going to have a custom website for legion pe, where you will be able to view stats of the server, info, donate, and view your own stats and leaderboards! we already have a big part of it done, view it here: http://legionpvp.eu/pe/web or http://legionpvp.eu/pe/tablet for tablets (mobile coming soon!)
be aware the website isn't fully functional
 

level functions:

~ hub:
	portals!

~ PVP:
	killstreaks!
		every time you kill a player, you should get a message like this:
		You have killed $player!
		You now have a total of $kills kills.
		Your killstreak is $killstreak!
		if you have a killstreak of 3, broadcast to the chat "$player has got a TRIPLE KILL!"
		if you have a killstreak of 5, broadcast to chat "$player has got a killstreak of 5!"
		and the same goes on for a kill streak of 10, 25, 50, 75, 100
	shop!
		every time you kill a player, you will earn 1 coin
		with those coins, you will be able to buy/upgrade items of your current kit
		for a example, if you currently have a leather helmet, chestplate, leggings and boots,
		you will be able to upgrade to a gold helmet, chestplate, etc... but you will have to buy them with coins
		to buy these items, you can go to a shop under spawn and there will be signs like this:
		[PVP Shop]
		Buy
		GOLDEN_HELMET
		for 100 coins

		for PEMapModder: please make the signs customisable so the prices aren't hardcoded
	leaderboard!
		there will be a in-game leaderboard (top 10 players with kills + KD) and a online leaderboard (hopefully all players) (don't worry pemapmodder, I will do web dev!)
~

	teams!
		you will be able to create teams, there isn't much more to it :P

~ SPLEEF:
	multi-level arenas!
		this will be a feature added in the future, and it will only be added if spleef is popular :P
	leaderboard!
		there will be a in-game leaderboard (top 10 players with wins + WLR win loose ratio) and a online leaderboard (hopefully all players) (don't worry pemapmodder, I will do web dev!)
	bug free!
		if you used to play spleef on the old legion pe, you should know that it was very buggy at the time and that there
		were players that kept glitching in and out of the arenas, well in the new plugin that should all be fixed!

~ PARKOUR:
	checkpoints and different levels!
		at the moment, we only have one level and different checkpoints, but in the future we are hoping to have
		multiple levels all with checkpoints
	timer!
		there will be a timer for the shorter maps that don't have a checkpoint, and again, hopefully a online leaderboard
		for that too!

~ INFECTED!
	more info soon... we will start development on this once our other mini-games are done

will continue writing soon (maybe?)
